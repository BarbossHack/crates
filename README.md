Hello Rust & VSCode lovers,

This is **crates**, an extension for *crates.io* dependencies. Aims helping developers to manage dependencies while using _Cargo.toml_.

## Notes

* It is only helpful if you are using dependencies from _crates.io_. Dependencies from _git_ or other platforms are not supported.
* TOML must be valid. If not crates will not show versions. It will inform you with. status bar and dialog.


## Features

**crates** is very simple. It has just two features.

- Displays the latest version of the crate next to it
- Shows all versions (clickable) on tooltip of the crate hovered.

Aims to be fast and simple.

`crates.listPreReleases` : If true, pre-release versions will be listed in hover and at decoration. Default is false.
